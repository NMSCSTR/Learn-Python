# Activity: Creating and Manipulating a 2D List
# Create a 2D list:

Create a 3x3 matrix (a list of lists) that represents a tic-tac-toe board. 
Each element can be 'X', 'O', or an empty string '' to represent the spots.
"""

# Access elements in the 2D list: (Provide the code and the output)
"""
Print the value at the second row and third column (index [1][2]).
Print the entire first row (index [0]).
"""

#Modify an element: (Provide the output)
"""Change the element in the second row and second column (index [1][1]) to 'X'."""

# Iterate over the 2D list: (Provide the output)
"""Loop through each row, and within each row, loop through each element to print it."""
